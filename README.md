This project is a iOS-Swift project I have done during my last year of university.

I had fun programming that project!

In that project, I have mostly manipulated the webviewController, the navigationController, the tableViewController.. 
I also learned how to manipulate the navigation bar, the toolbar and the tabBarController.

This allowed me to get introduced to threads in iOS. In fact, in the tableViewController, I load the images in a background thread to load
the cells quicker and then cache them with the SDWebImage framework.

To sum up, it was a lot of fun!
